# 🔥 Firefront - A Wildfire Crisis Game (Prototype)

**Creating Web Experiences for Digital Humanities – Prototype 1**

This is the first interactive prototype of a turn-based crisis simulation game centered around **wildfire management**. The game is built to explore **user experience design**, **visual feedback**, and **strategic decision-making under constraints**, all within a digital humanities context.

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

You are an emergency response coordinator during a wildfire outbreak. Your mission:  
🧯 Suppress fires, 🏠 protect cities, and 💧 manage limited water and firefighting resources — all while the fire spreads with the wind.

---

## 🧪 This Prototype Demonstrates:

- A **dynamic grid-based fire system** where fires evolve over time.
- **Turn-based unit deployment** (trucks, helicopters, planes) with cooldowns.
- A **resource system** (water) that regenerates each round.
- Visual feedback for:
  - 🔥 Fire stages (1 to 5)
  - 💀 Burned terrain
  - 💧 Suppression effects
  - 🌬️ Wind direction and speed
- A **scoring system** based on damage containment.

## 🧩 Game Mechanics

| Mechanic          | Details                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔥 Fire Spread     | Increases each turn, influenced by wind direction and speed.           |
| 💧 Water Resource  | Starts at 15, regenerates +5 per turn (max 15).                         |
| 🚒 Firefighting Units | Each unit has a water cost and cooldown time:                          |
|                   | • Truck (1 water, 1-turn cooldown)                                      |
|                   | • Helicopter (5 water, 2-turn cooldown)                                 |
|                   | • Plane (9 water, 3-turn cooldown)                                      |
| ⏱️ Cooldowns        | Used units are temporarily unavailable for a set number of turns.      |
| 🪵 Firebreaks       | Can be placed before the fire starts to prevent spread.                |
| 📊 Score           | Penalties applied based on fire severity and area damage.              |

- **Modular architecture** for rapid prototyping and iteration

---

## 🚧 Upcoming Features (for future iterations)

- Multiple difficulty levels
- Unit upgrades or random events  
- Narrative framing and progression system  
- Improved UI, animations, and sound

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Vanilla)
- DOM-based rendering and event handling
- Modular code for easy expansion

---

## 📂 How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No server required.
